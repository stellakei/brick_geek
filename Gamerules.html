                    <h1>How to play</h1>
                    <h4>Start the game on the lowest level.</h4>
                    <p>Tetris games provide a Marathon Mode that lets you pick your level, which will determine how fast
                        the tetrominos fall. The game will increase the level every 10 lines that are cleared to give
                        you a challenge.</p>
                    <h4>Move the tetrominos.</h4>
                    <p>You can move them left and right, and you can rotate them in both directions. (up is clockwise,
                        and You can also speed up their fall (known as "Soft Drop" used with the down button or s) or
                        you can immediately set it down (known as "Hard Drop" used with the space bar).</p>
                    <h4>Understand the different tetrominos.</h4>
                    <p>There are seven different types of tetriminos: the I, O, L, J, S, Z, and T tetriminos.</p>
                    <h4>Complete lines to gain points and raise the level.</h4>
                    <p>When a line of blocks is created, the entire line disappears, points are rewarded and the stack
                        is pushed down. The more lines completed at once, the more points gained. Completing the maximum
                        number of lines at once, four, is known as a 'Tetris' and can only be pulled off with the
                        I-tetrimino.</p>
                    <h4>Check upcoming pieces and plan for them.</h4>
                    <p>This will become easier the more you play, don't rush yourself.</p>
